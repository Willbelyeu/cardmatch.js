# Overview

This is a simple Memory Match game created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game features cards that the player has to match in pairs. The goal is to test memory and reaction time.

This project was made to practice JavaScript and improve my understanding of how it interacts with HTML and CSS to create interactive web applications.
